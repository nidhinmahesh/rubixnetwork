# Rubix - ProofChain

A deterministic state-machine that is designed to address the scale, cost, and privacy shortcomings of blockchain protocols that rely on one sequentially organized chain of all global transactions. The global state-machine is divided into finite number of state-machines called ProofChains. While each ProofChain maintains one state, together all ProofChains represent a globally accessible singleton state that is immutable.

# Features

* Instant Confirmation and Finality of Transaction
* Asynchronous Parallelism
* Proof of Pledge (PoP)
* Double Spending and Fork Resolution
* Hard capped native tokens with publicly verifiable , immutable mathematical proofs
* Non-Linear Secret Sharing (NLSS)

# Getting Started

1. Follow the Rubix [Installation Procedure](https://learn.rubix.net/node-setup) (including wallet) depending on your OS.
2. You can query at [Rubix Discussion Forum](https://t.me/joinchat/FVW78xbBBvefEUSBB0p4Fw).
